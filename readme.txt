Get Your Website Crawled Immediately by Google Using Their NEW Indexing API

== Description ==

Thanks to Googleâ€™s Indexing API, Rank Math SEO for WordPress and this guide weâ€™ve put together for you, itâ€™s now possible for you to get your website to rank faster.

The process of setting this up isnâ€™t typically very easy, but if you follow this step-by-step guide, youâ€™ll be up and running (or, I guess you could say up and ranking) in no time! So, without further ado â€“ letâ€™s jump right in and take a look at how to set this up.

[Instant Indexing API Setup Guide](https://rankmath.com/blog/google-indexing-api/)

**Note:** Google recommends that you use the Indexing API ONLY for Job Posting and Live Streaming websites. During our tests, we found that it works on any type of website with great results and created this plugin for testing.

If you are not sure whether you want to be using this or not, please stop reading and donâ€™t proceed further. As Google recommends, you should not use this indexing API on money websites. Please proceed at your own risk.

We understand this is not for everyone ðŸ™‚
